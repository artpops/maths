# Problem
(a) How many divisors of natural number 2000 are there?  
(b) Let $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ be distinct prime numbers, and $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m$ be positive integers. Determine the number of divisors of the positive integer $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_m^{k_m}$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

## Part (a)

1. **Prime Factorization of 2000**:
    - First, factorize 2000 into its prime factors:
    $$
    2000 = 2^4 \times 5^3
    $$

2. **Determine the Number of Divisors**:
    - Using the prime factorization, the number of divisors can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents and then multiplying the results:
    $$
    (4+1)(3+1) = 5 \times 4 = 20
    $$

Therefore, the number of divisors of 2000 is 20.

## Part (b)

1. **General Formula for the Number of Divisors**:
    - For a number $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_m^{k_m}$, the number of divisors is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents and then multiplying the results:
    $$
    (k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)
    $$

Therefore, the number of divisors of the positive integer $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_m^{k_m}$ is $(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)$.
