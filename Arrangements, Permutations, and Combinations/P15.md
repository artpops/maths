# Problem
Given $n \geq 4$ points in space, such that no four of them belong to the same plane, how many planes are determined by these points?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of planes that can be formed by $n$ points in space, given that no four points are coplanar.

2. **Selection of Points**:
    - A plane is uniquely determined by any three points.
    - Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to select 3 points out of $n$.

3. **Use Combinatorial Formula**:
    - The number of ways to choose 3 points from $n$ is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
    $$

Therefore, the number of planes determined by $n$ points in space, where no four points are coplanar, is $\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose triplets of points.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{3}$ to calculate the number of triplets.
3. **Plane Determination**: Understanding that a plane is uniquely defined by any three points.
