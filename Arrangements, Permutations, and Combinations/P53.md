# Problem
Let us take $n$ distinct signal flags and $k$ masts arranged in a sequence. A signal is determined by distributing all the given flags on the masts, and by the order of the flags on every mast. Determine the number $A(n,k)$ of all possible signals.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We have $n$ distinct signal flags.
    - There are $k$ masts.
    - We need to determine the number of ways to distribute all $n$ flags among $k$ masts, considering both the distribution and the order of the flags on each mast.

2. **Distribution and Order**:
    - Since the flags are distinct and their order on each mast matters, we are dealing with permutations and partitions.
    - Each flag can go to any of the $k$ masts, and the order in which flags are placed on the masts also matters.

3. **Formulating the Problem**:
    - First, we need to choose which mast each flag will go to. Since each of the $n$ flags can go to any of the $k$ masts, there are $k^n$ ways to distribute the flags.
    - Next, for each distribution, we need to consider the permutations of the flags on each mast.

4. **Calculation**:
    - The number of ways to distribute the $n$ flags among the $k$ masts is $k^n$.
    - For each of these distributions, the order of the flags on each mast is considered. Since the flags are distinct and their order on each mast matters, the number of permutations of $n$ flags is $n!$.

5. **Combining the Results**:
    - The total number of possible signals is given by the product of the number of distributions and the number of permutations of the flags:
    $$
    A(n, k) = k^n \times n!
    $$

    Therefore, the number of all possible signals is:
    $$
    A(n, k) = \boxed{k^n \cdot n!}
    $$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Calculating permutations using $n!$.
2. **Combinatorial Counting**: Distributing $n$ distinct items into $k$ distinct groups.
