# Problem
Let us take a deck of cards consisting of 8 red, 8 blue, 8 yellow, and 8 green cards. Cards of the same color are numbered 1, 2, \ldots, 8. How many ways can 6 cards be chosen such that at least one card of each color is chosen?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to choose 6 cards from a deck consisting of 32 cards (8 of each color) such that at least one card of each color (red, blue, yellow, green) is included.

2. **Distribution of Cards**:
    - We need at least one card of each color (4 colors) among the 6 cards chosen. This leaves us with 2 remaining cards to choose freely from the deck.

3. **Cases to Consider**:
    - Case 1: We choose 1 card from each of the 4 colors and 2 additional cards from any of the 4 colors.
    - This can happen in two subcases:
      - Case 1a: The 2 additional cards are both of the same color.
      - Case 1b: The 2 additional cards are from two different colors.

4. **Calculate Each Case**:
    - **Case 1a**:
        - Choose 1 card from each of the 4 colors: $8^4$
        - Choose 1 color for the additional 2 cards: $\binom{4}{1} = 4$
        - Choose 2 cards from the chosen color: $\binom{8}{2}$

        Total ways for Case 1a:
        $$
        8^4 \times 4 \times \binom{8}{2}
        $$

    - **Case 1b**:
        - Choose 1 card from each of the 4 colors: $8^4$
        - Choose 2 colors for the additional cards: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$
        - Choose 1 card from each of these 2 colors: $8^2$

        Total ways for Case 1b:
        $$
        8^4 \times 6 \times 8^2
        $$

5. **Combine Both Cases**:
    - Total number of ways:
    $$
    8^4 \times 4 \times \binom{8}{2} + 8^4 \times 6 \times 8^2
    $$

    Simplifying:
    $$
    8^4 \times (4 \times \binom{8}{2} + 6 \times 8^2)
    $$
    $$
    8^4 \times (4 \times 28 + 6 \times 64)
    $$
    $$
    8^4 \times (112 + 384)
    $$
    $$
    8^4 \times 496
    $$
    Since $8^4 = 4096$:
    $$
    4096 \times 496 = 2031616
    $$

Therefore, there are 2,031,616 ways to choose 6 cards such that at least one card of each color is chosen.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements.
3. **Cases and Subcases**: Considering different cases based on the distribution of cards among colors.
