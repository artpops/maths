# Problem
Let $S$ be the set of all $2n$-arrangements of elements 0 and 1 that have the type $(n,n)$. For any $v = (c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{2n}) \in S$, we define the characteristic $C(v)$ to be the number of pairs $(c_i, c_{i+1})$, $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 2n-1\}$, such that $c_i \neq c_{i+1}$. For any $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 2n-1\}$, let $S_1$ be the set of arrangements $v \in S$ such that $C(v) = n - k$, and $S_2$ be the set of arrangements $v \in S$ such that $C(v) = n + k$. Prove that $|S_1| = |S_2|$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Set $S$**:
    - The set $S$ consists of all sequences of length $2n$ that contain exactly $n$ zeros and $n$ ones.
    - The characteristic $C(v)$ counts the number of adjacent pairs $(c_i, c_{i+1})$ such that $c_i \neq c_{i+1}$.

2. **Characteristic $C(v)$**:
    - For any valid arrangement $v$, the maximum possible value for $C(v)$ is $2n-1$, which occurs when the sequence alternates between 0 and 1.
    - The minimum possible value for $C(v)$ is 1, which occurs when the sequence is divided into two contiguous blocks, one of 0's and one of 1's.

3. **Sets $S_1$ and $S_2$**:
    - $S_1$ is the set of sequences where the characteristic $C(v) = n - k$.
    - $S_2$ is the set of sequences where the characteristic $C(v) = n + k$.
    - We need to show that these sets have the same number of elements.

4. **Bijective Proof**:
    - Construct a bijection between $S_1$ and $S_2$.
    - Given any sequence $v \in S_1$ with $C(v) = n - k$, we need to transform it into a sequence in $S_2$ with $C(v) = n + k$.
    - One such transformation is to flip (swap 0's and 1's) the elements between any $k$ adjacent pairs where $c_i \neq c_{i+1}$. This ensures that the new sequence will have $C(v) = n + k$.

5. **Transforming Sequences**:
    - Given a sequence $v \in S_1$, identify the positions where $c_i \neq c_{i+1}$.
    - Choose any $k$ of these positions and flip the elements between these pairs.
    - The resulting sequence will have $C(v) = n + k$ and belong to $S_2$.
    - This transformation is reversible, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between $S_1$ and $S_2$.

6. **Conclusion**:
    - Since there is a bijection between $S_1$ and $S_2$, we have $|S_1| = |S_2|$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorial Proof**: Constructing a bijection between two sets to prove they have the same cardinality.
2. **Characteristic Function**: Counting specific properties in sequences.
3. **Transformation of Sequences**: Using element flips to map sequences from one set to another.
