# Problem
How many ways are there to put $n_1$ blue balls, $n_2$ yellow balls, and $n_3$ red balls into $m$ boxes numbered $1, 2, \ldots, m$? Balls of the same color are indistinguishable.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to distribute $n_1$ blue balls, $n_2$ yellow balls, and $n_3$ red balls into $m$ boxes where each box is distinguishable, but the balls of the same color are indistinguishable.

2. **Distribute Each Color of Balls**:
    - We can treat the distribution of each color of balls separately using the stars and bars method.

3. **Distribute $n_1$ Blue Balls**:
    - The number of ways to distribute $n_1$ indistinguishable blue balls into $m$ distinguishable boxes is given by:
    $$
    \binom{n_1 + m - 1}{m - 1}
    $$

4. **Distribute $n_2$ Yellow Balls**:
    - Similarly, the number of ways to distribute $n_2$ indistinguishable yellow balls into $m$ distinguishable boxes is given by:
    $$
    \binom{n_2 + m - 1}{m - 1}
    $$

5. **Distribute $n_3$ Red Balls**:
    - The number of ways to distribute $n_3$ indistinguishable red balls into $m$ distinguishable boxes is given by:
    $$
    \binom{n_3 + m - 1}{m - 1}
    $$

6. **Combine the Distributions**:
    - Since the distribution of each color of balls is independent of the others, we multiply the number of ways for each color.

7. **Total Number of Ways**:
    $$
    \binom{n_1 + m - 1}{m - 1} \times \binom{n_2 + m - 1}{m - 1} \times \binom{n_3 + m - 1}{m - 1}
    $$

Therefore, the total number of ways to put $n_1$ blue balls, $n_2$ yellow balls, and $n_3$ red balls into $m$ boxes is:
$$
\binom{n_1 + m - 1}{m - 1} \times \binom{n_2 + m - 1}{m - 1} \times \binom{n_3 + m - 1}{m - 1}
$$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Stars and Bars**: A method for distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins.
2. **Binomial Coefficients**: Used to calculate the number of ways to distribute balls.
3. **Multiplication Principle**: Combining independent distributions by multiplying the number of ways for each.
