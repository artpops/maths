# Problem
How many $n$-arrangements of the elements $0, 1, \ldots, n$ are there with an even number of $0$'s?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the number of permutations of the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ such that the number of $0$'s in the permutation is even.

2. **Count the Total Permutations**:
    - The total number of $n$-arrangements (permutations) of the elements $0, 1, \ldots, n$ is $(n+1)!$.

3. **Divide the Problem**:
    - We need to divide the problem into two cases: permutations with an even number of $0$'s and permutations with an odd number of $0$'s.
    - Since the number of $0$'s can only be either even or odd, and each permutation must have exactly $n+1$ elements, the counts of permutations with even and odd numbers of $0$'s must be equal.

4. **Equal Division**:
    - Because the total number of permutations is $(n+1)!$ and they must be equally split between even and odd numbers of $0$'s:
    - The number of permutations with an even number of $0$'s is:
    $$
    \frac{(n+1)!}{2}
    $$

5. **Generalization**:
    - This logic holds for any $n$, as the permutation symmetry ensures equal distribution between even and odd counts of $0$'s.

Therefore, the number of $n$-arrangements of the elements $0, 1, \ldots, n$ with an even number of $0$'s is $\frac{(n+1)!}{2}$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Counting the total number of ways to arrange $n+1$ elements.
2. **Symmetry and Equal Division**: Using symmetry to deduce that permutations are evenly split between even and odd counts of a specific element.
3. **Factorials**: Understanding the total number of permutations as $(n+1)!$.
