# Problem
How many ways are there to put 8 red balls, 9 blue balls, and 10 yellow balls into three boxes numbered 1, 2, and 3, such that any box contains at least one ball of each color?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to distribute 8 red balls, 9 blue balls, and 10 yellow balls into 3 distinguishable boxes, such that each box contains at least one ball of each color.

2. **Initial Distribution of Balls**:
    - First, ensure that each box contains at least one ball of each color.
    - This means we need to distribute 3 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 3 yellow balls (one of each color to each box).
    - This uses up 3 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 3 yellow balls, leaving us with 5 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 7 yellow balls to distribute freely.

3. **Distribution Using Stars and Bars**:
    - Now, distribute the remaining balls:
        - 5 red balls into 3 boxes.
        - 6 blue balls into 3 boxes.
        - 7 yellow balls into 3 boxes.
    - We use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to distribute these remaining balls.

4. **Calculate the Ways for Each Color**:
    - For red balls: 
    $$
    \binom{5 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{7}{2}
    $$
    - For blue balls:
    $$
    \binom{6 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{8}{2}
    $$
    - For yellow balls:
    $$
    \binom{7 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{9}{2}
    $$

5. **Combine the Results**:
    - Multiply the number of ways for each color:
    $$
    \binom{7}{2} \times \binom{8}{2} \times \binom{9}{2}
    $$
    - Calculate each binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = 21
    $$
    $$
    \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8 \times 7}{2 \times 1} = 28
    $$
    $$
    \binom{9}{2} = \frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2 \times 1} = 36
    $$

6. **Final Calculation**:
    - Multiply these results together to get the total number of ways:
    $$
    21 \times 28 \times 36
    $$
    - Perform the multiplication:
    $$
    21 \times 28 = 588
    $$
    $$
    588 \times 36 = 21168
    $$

Therefore, the number of ways to put 8 red balls, 9 blue balls, and 10 yellow balls into three boxes numbered 1, 2, and 3, such that any box contains at least one ball of each color, is $21,168$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Stars and Bars**: A method for distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins.
2. **Binomial Coefficients**: Used to calculate the number of ways to distribute balls.
3. **Multiplication Principle**: Combining independent distributions by multiplying the number of ways for each.
