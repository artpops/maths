# Problem
Determine the number of 0's at the end of the decimal representation of the positive integer $144!$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - The number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number is determined by the number of times the factor 10 appears in the factorization of that number.
    - Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 appears in the factorization of $144!$.

2. **Count the Factors of 5**:
    - We need to count the number of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., in the numbers from 1 to 144.
    - The formula to find the number of factors of a prime $p$ in $n!$ is given by:
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
    $$
    - For $n = 144$ and $p = 5$, we calculate:
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{144}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{144}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{144}{125} \right\rfloor
    $$

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
    - Calculate each term:
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{144}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 28.8 \right\rfloor = 28
    $$
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{144}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 5.76 \right\rfloor = 5
    $$
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{144}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.152 \right\rfloor = 1
    $$

4. **Sum the Results**:
    - The total number of factors of 5 in $144!$ is:
    $$
    28 + 5 + 1 = 34
    $$

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of $144!$ is 34.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Factorization**: Breaking down a number into its prime factors.
2. **Counting Factors in Factorials**: Using the formula to count the number of times a prime number appears in the factorization of a factorial.
3. **Floor Function**: Using the floor function $\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$ to count the multiples of powers of 5.
