# Problem
Suppose that 5 points are given in the plane so that the following two conditions are satisfied. 
1. No three of these points are collinear. 
2. There are no parallel or perpendicular lines among those that are determined by the given points. 

From each of the given 5 points, a perpendicular is dropped to each of the lines determined by the other 5 points. Determine the greatest possible value of the number of points of intersection of these perpendiculars.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We have 5 points in the plane, with no three points collinear and no lines determined by these points being parallel or perpendicular.
    - Perpendiculars are dropped from each point to the lines determined by the other 5 points.
    - We need to find the maximum number of intersection points of these perpendiculars.

2. **Lines Determined by the Points**:
    - The number of lines determined by 5 points, no three of which are collinear, is given by:
    $$
    \binom{5}{2} = 10
    $$

3. **Perpendiculars from Each Point**:
    - From each of the 5 points, perpendiculars are dropped to the lines determined by the other 4 points.
    - Each point will have perpendiculars dropped to the 4 lines formed by the other 4 points.

4. **Number of Perpendiculars**:
    - For each of the 5 points, there are 4 perpendiculars, resulting in:
    $$
    5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ perpendiculars}
    $$

5. **Intersection of Perpendiculars**:
    - Each perpendicular from one point to a line can intersect with the perpendicular from another point to the same line.
    - There are 4 perpendiculars for each line, and the number of ways to choose 2 perpendiculars from 4 to form an intersection point on each line is:
    $$
    \binom{4}{2} = 6
    $$
    - Since there are 10 lines, the total number of intersection points is:
    $$
    10 \times 6 = 60
    $$

Therefore, the greatest possible value of the number of points of intersection of these perpendiculars is:
$$
60
$$
