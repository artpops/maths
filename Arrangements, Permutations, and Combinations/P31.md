# Problem
Determine the sum of all 4-digit positive integers, such that there are two different even digits and two equal odd digits in the decimal representation of each of them.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the Digits**:
    - The even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
    - The odd digits are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

2. **Form the Number**:
    - We need to form a 4-digit number with two different even digits and two equal odd digits.
    - The positions of the digits can vary, so we need to consider all permutations where two digits are the same.

3. **Count the Valid Numbers**:
    - Choose two different even digits: $\binom{5}{2} = 10$.
    - Choose one odd digit (which will be repeated twice): $\binom{5}{1} = 5$.
    - Arrange these four digits where two are the same: $\frac{4!}{2!} = 12$.

4. **Total Count of Numbers**:
    - The total number of valid 4-digit numbers is:
    $$
    10 \times 5 \times 12 = 600
    $$

5. **Calculate the Sum**:
    - Consider the sum of the digits in each position (units, tens, hundreds, thousands).

6. **Sum of Even Digits**:
    - Sum of two different even digits from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 is: $0+2+4+6+8 = 20$.
    - Total number of arrangements: $\binom{5}{2} \times 2 = 10 \times 2 = 20$ ways.
    - Total sum of even digits is: $20 \times \frac{600}{20} = 600 \times 1 = 600$.

7. **Sum of Odd Digits**:
    - Sum of one odd digit repeated twice from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is: $(1+3+5+7+9) \times 2 = 50 \times 2 = 100$.
    - Total number of arrangements: $5 \times \frac{600}{5} = 120$ ways.
    - Total sum of odd digits is: $100 \times \frac{600}{20} = 3000$.

8. **Calculate the Final Sum**:
    - Sum of all digits in each place (units, tens, hundreds, thousands).
    - Number of times each digit appears: $(2 \times 5 \times 12) = 10 \times 12 = 120$.
    - Each place value contributes $6000$ (10 times each for 600 numbers).

Therefore, the sum of all 4-digit positive integers, such that there are two different even digits and two equal odd digits in the decimal representation, is $120,000$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations and Combinations**: Counting the number of ways to choose and arrange digits.
2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: Summing digits based on their frequency and position.
3. **Factorial Division**: Using factorials to account for repeated digits in permutations.
