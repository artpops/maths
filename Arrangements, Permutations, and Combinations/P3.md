# Problem
Twelve basketball teams take part in a tournament. How many possible ways are there for the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to determine the number of ways to award gold, silver, and bronze medals to three different teams out of twelve.

2. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose the Medals**:
    - For the gold medal, there are 12 possible teams.
    - For the silver medal, there are 11 remaining teams.
    - For the bronze medal, there are 10 remaining teams.

    The total number of combinations is:
    $12 \times 11 \times 10$

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
    $12 \times 11 \times 10 = 1320$

Therefore, there are 1320 possible ways to distribute the gold, silver, and bronze medals among the twelve basketball teams.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items (teams) where the order matters.
2. **Counting Principle**: Multiplying the number of choices for each independent event.
