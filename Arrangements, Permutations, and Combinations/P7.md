# Problem
In a big country, no two citizens have the same arrangement of teeth. What is the maximal possible number of citizens in this country?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - Each citizen has a unique arrangement of teeth.
    - We need to determine the maximum number of unique arrangements of teeth possible.

2. **Analyze the Possible Arrangements of Teeth**:
    - Humans typically have 32 teeth.
    - Each tooth can either be present or absent, which gives us 2 possible states for each tooth.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**:
    - Since each of the 32 teeth can be in 2 states (present or absent), the total number of unique arrangements is given by:
    $$
    2^{32}
    $$

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
    - Calculate $2^{32}$:
    $$
    2^{32} = 4,294,967,296
    $$

Therefore, the maximal possible number of citizens in this country, each with a unique arrangement of teeth, is $4,294,967,296$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Binary Choices**: Each tooth can either be present or absent, representing two states.
2. **Exponentiation**: The total number of unique arrangements is given by raising the number of choices (2) to the power of the number of items (32 teeth).
