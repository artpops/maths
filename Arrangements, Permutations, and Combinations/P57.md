# Problem
Determine the greatest possible number of 3-subsets of the set $N_n = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, such that any two of these subsets contain exactly one common element.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to form 3-element subsets from $N_n$.
    - Each pair of these subsets must share exactly one element.

2. **Constraints and Conditions**:
    - Let's denote a 3-subset as $\{a, b, c\}$.
    - If $\{a, b, c\}$ and $\{a, d, e\}$ share exactly one element, then $a$ is the common element.
    - This condition must hold for all pairs of subsets.

3. **Analyze the Structure**:
    - Consider the set $N_n = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
    - Each subset is a 3-element subset from $N_n$.

4. **Combining Constraints**:
    - Let's denote the 3-subsets as $\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$, where $m$ is the number of such 3-subsets.
    - For each pair $\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$ and $\{a_j, b_j, c_j\}$, there must be exactly one common element.

5. **Designing the Solution**:
    - Fix one element as the common element and choose 2 others from the remaining $n-1$ elements.
    - For example, fix element $1$, then choose any 2 from $n-1$ elements.

6. **Counting Subsets**:
    - The number of ways to choose 2 elements from $n-1$ elements is $\binom{n-1}{2}$.
    - Repeat this for each of the $n$ elements.

7. **Maximizing the Number of 3-Subsets**:
    - Each element can be common in $\binom{n-1}{2}$ subsets.
    - For $n$ elements, this results in $n \cdot \binom{n-1}{2}$ subsets.

8. **Mathematical Expression**:
    - The total number of 3-subsets is:
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \binom{n-1}{2}
    $$
    - Since each element can be common in $\binom{n-1}{2}$ subsets.

# Conclusion
The greatest possible number of 3-subsets of the set $N_n$ such that any two of these subsets contain exactly one common element is:
$$
\boxed{n \cdot \binom{n-1}{2}}
$$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Counting the number of ways to select 2 elements from $n-1$.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n-1}{2}$ to count subsets.
3. **Summation**: Summing the contributions from all elements.
