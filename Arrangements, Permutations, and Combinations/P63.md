# Problem
Suppose that $m + n$ persons are in a line in front of a box office. Each of them intends to buy a ticket, and the ticket price is \$5. Suppose that $m$ of the persons in the line have \$5 notes, and all of the remaining $n$ persons have a \$10 note. Assume also that $m > n$. How many ways can the line be rearranged, such that no one in the line with a \$10 note will wait for change, if:

(a) there is no money in the cash register at the beginning?  
(b) there are $k$ \$5 notes in the cash register, where $k < n \leq k + m$?

# Step-by-Step Solution

## Part (a)
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - There are $m$ people with \$5 notes and $n$ people with \$10 notes.
    - We need to arrange them such that no one with a \$10 note waits for change.

2. **Condition**:
    - A person with a \$10 note can only be in a position where there are already people with \$5 notes who have paid.

3. **Counting the Valid Arrangements**:
    - This is a classic problem that can be solved using the concept of Catalan numbers.
    - The number of valid arrangements is given by the Catalan number $C_m$, where $m$ is the number of people with \$5 notes and $n$ is the number of people with \$10 notes.

4. **Catalan Numbers**:
    - The Catalan number $C_n$ is given by:
    $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$

5. **Result**:
    - The number of ways to arrange the line is:
    $C_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \binom{2m}{m}$

## Part (b)
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - There are $k$ \$5 notes in the cash register initially.
    - We need to consider this initial condition when counting the valid arrangements.

2. **Condition**:
    - Each \$10 note must be preceded by a sufficient number of \$5 notes, including the initial $k$ \$5 notes.

3. **Adjustment for Initial \$5 Notes**:
    - We consider $k$ initial \$5 notes already in place.
    - Now, we need to arrange the remaining $m - k$ \$5 notes and $n$ \$10 notes.

4. **Result**:
    - The number of valid arrangements with $k$ initial \$5 notes can be calculated similarly to part (a), adjusting for the initial condition.

5. **Calculation**:
    - The number of ways to arrange the line is given by the adjusted Catalan number:
    $C_{m-k} = \frac{1}{(m-k)+1} \binom{2(m-k)}{m-k}$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Catalan Numbers**: A sequence of natural numbers with many applications in combinatorial mathematics.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: A coefficient of the expanded form of a binomial raised to a power, denoted as $\binom{n}{k}$.
