# Problem
An international jury consists of \( n \) members. Jury documents are stored in a safe box. The safe box has \( a \) locks, and each lock has \( b \) keys. Determine \( a \) and \( b \), and the distribution of the keys among the members of the jury if the following condition is satisfied: the safe box can be opened if and only if the number of jury members present is not less than \( m \), where \( m \in \{2, 3, \ldots, n-1\} \).

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of locks \( a \) and the number of keys \( b \) such that the safe can be opened if and only if at least \( m \) members of the jury are present.

2. **Key Concepts**:
    - This is a classic problem of secret sharing, where we want to ensure that at least \( m \) members are needed to unlock the safe, but any fewer than \( m \) members cannot do so.

3. **Threshold Scheme**:
    - The most relevant approach is the \( (m, n) \)-threshold scheme (also known as Shamir's Secret Sharing), where any \( m \) out of \( n \) members can unlock the safe.

4. **Number of Locks**:
    - In a threshold scheme, the number of locks required is typically equal to the threshold \( m \). Thus, \( a = m \).

5. **Number of Keys**:
    - Each member should be able to unlock the safe if they have the keys for at least \( m \) locks. This implies that each lock must have \( n - m + 1 \) keys distributed among the members to ensure that any \( m \) members can collectively open all the locks.
    - Therefore, \( b = n - m + 1 \).

6. **Distribution of Keys**:
    - Each member gets the keys for \( \binom{n-1}{m-1} \) combinations of the locks. This ensures that any \( m \) members together will have all the keys required to open the locks.

# Conclusion
The number of locks \( a \) and the number of keys \( b \) are:
$$
a = m \\
b = n - m + 1
$$

Each lock has \( b \) keys, and the distribution of keys among the members follows the \( (m, n) \)-threshold scheme ensuring that any \( m \) members can unlock the safe.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Threshold Scheme (Shamir's Secret Sharing)**: Ensuring that a certain number of members (threshold) can access the secret.
2. **Combination Counting**: Determining the number of keys each member should have.
