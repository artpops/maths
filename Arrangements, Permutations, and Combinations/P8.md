# Problem
Let $n \geq 2$. How many permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ are there, such that 1 and 2 are adjacent terms?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ where the elements 1 and 2 are adjacent.

2. **Group 1 and 2 Together**:
    - Consider 1 and 2 as a single block. This block can appear as either (1, 2) or (2, 1).

3. **Reduce the Problem to Permutations of $n-1$ Items**:
    - Since 1 and 2 are treated as a single block, we now have $n-1$ items to arrange (the block of 1 and 2 plus the remaining $n-2$ elements).

4. **Calculate the Number of Permutations**:
    - The number of ways to arrange $n-1$ items is $(n-1)!$.
    - Since the block of 1 and 2 can be either (1, 2) or (2, 1), we multiply by 2.

    The total number of permutations is:
    $$
    2 \times (n-1)!
    $$

Therefore, the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that 1 and 2 are adjacent terms is $2 \times (n-1)!$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items where the order matters.
2. **Grouping**: Treating adjacent elements as a single block to simplify counting.
3. **Factorials**: Using $(n-1)!$ to count the arrangements of $n-1$ items.
