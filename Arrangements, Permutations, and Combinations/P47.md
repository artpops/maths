# Problem
How many triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of positive integers are there such that
(a) $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^3$?
(b) $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^3$ and $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3$?

# Step-by-Step Solution

## Part (a)

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of positive integer solutions to the equation $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^3$.

2. **Prime Factorization**:
    - $10^3 = 1000 = 2^3 \times 5^3$.
    - We need to distribute the factors $2^3$ and $5^3$ among $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.

3. **Distribution of Factors**:
    - Let $x_1 = 2^{a_1} \times 5^{b_1}$,
      $x_2 = 2^{a_2} \times 5^{b_2}$, and
      $x_3 = 2^{a_3} \times 5^{b_3}$.
    - We need to solve the equations:
      $$
      a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3
      $$
      $$
      b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 3
      $$

4. **Using Stars and Bars**:
    - The number of non-negative integer solutions to $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3$ is given by:
      $$
      \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
      $$
    - Similarly, the number of non-negative integer solutions to $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 3$ is:
      $$
      \binom{5}{2} = 10
      $$

5. **Total Number of Solutions**:
    - Since the distributions of the factors of 2 and 5 are independent, we multiply the number of solutions:
      $$
      10 \times 10 = 100
      $$

## Part (b)

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of solutions $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^3$ and $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3$.

2. **Use Symmetry and Counting**:
    - From part (a), we have 100 solutions $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ where the order matters.
    - We need to count the number of distinct sets $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ where $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3$.

3. **Identifying Distinct Sets**:
    - Each distinct set $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ can appear in $3! = 6$ different permutations (since all $x_i$ are distinct).
    - If some $x_i$ are equal, the count of permutations is adjusted accordingly.

4. **Apply Burnside's Lemma (for counting distinct permutations)**:
    - Consider different cases for $x_1, x_2, x_3$ being equal.

5. **Simplified Counting**:
    - We count and verify each distinct set.

6. **Final Calculation**:
    - After counting all distinct sets and applying the necessary adjustments for repetitions, we get:
      $$
      \text{Number of distinct triples} = 19
      $$

Therefore, the number of triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^3$ is $100$, and the number of triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 10^3$ and $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3$ is $19$.
