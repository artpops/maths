# Problem
Let $k, n, p \in \mathbb{N}$, $k \geq 3$, $n \geq (k+1)p$, and let $A_1 A_2 \ldots A_n$ be a convex $n$-gon. How many ways can $k$ vertices of the $n$-gon be chosen, such that there are at least $p$ other vertices of the $n$-gon between any two of them?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to select $k$ vertices from an $n$-gon such that between any two chosen vertices, there are at least $p$ other vertices.
    - This implies that the selected vertices must be sufficiently spaced apart.

2. **Constraints and Conditions**:
    - The spacing condition: Between any two selected vertices, there must be at least $p$ vertices.
    - Mathematically, this means that for any two selected vertices $A_i$ and $A_j$, the indices must satisfy $|i - j| > p$.
    - Since the $n$-gon is convex and cyclic, we need to consider this condition in a cyclic manner.

3. **Simplify the Problem**:
    - Convert the problem into a linear selection problem by "unrolling" the $n$-gon. 
    - Imagine the vertices as a linear sequence and then apply the cyclic condition by ensuring that we do not select vertices that are too close when the sequence wraps around.

4. **Transforming the Problem**:
    - Consider selecting $k$ vertices out of $n$ in a linear sequence such that the spacing condition is maintained.
    - Convert the spacing condition into a problem of selecting positions with gaps:
        - Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ be the positions of the selected vertices.
        - The gaps between consecutive selected positions must be at least $p + 1$.

5. **Using Combinatorial Counting**:
    - We need to account for the gaps:
        - Let $y_i = x_{i+1} - x_i - 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k-1$, and $y_k = x_1 + n - x_k - 1$.
    - These $y_i$ values represent the gaps between the selected vertices.
    - We have $y_1 + y_2 + \ldots + y_k = n - k(p+1)$.

6. **Applying Stars and Bars**:
    - The total number of ways to distribute the remaining $n - k(p+1)$ gaps into $k$ parts is given by the stars and bars method.
    - We need to place $n - k(p+1)$ "stars" into $k$ "bins" (gaps).

7. **Calculation**:
    - The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{n - k(p + 1) + k - 1}{k - 1} = \binom{n - k(p + 1) + k - 1}{k - 1}
    $$

# Conclusion
The number of ways to choose $k$ vertices from an $n$-gon such that there are at least $p$ other vertices between any two of them is:
$$
\boxed{\binom{n - k(p + 1) + k - 1}{k - 1}}
$$
