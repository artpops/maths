# Problem
Let $(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)$ be a permutation of the set $N_n = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. A pair $(p_i, p_j)$ is called an inversion if $(i - j)(p_i - p_j) < 0$. Determine the total number of inversions in all permutations of the set $N_n$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the total number of inversions across all permutations of the set $N_n$.
    - An inversion in a permutation $(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)$ is a pair $(p_i, p_j)$ such that $(i - j)(p_i - p_j) < 0$, which means $i < j$ and $p_i > p_j$.

2. **Total Number of Permutations**:
    - The total number of permutations of the set $N_n$ is $n!$.

3. **Counting Inversions in a Single Permutation**:
    - For a given permutation, we need to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $i < j$ and $p_i > p_j$.
    - For example, in the permutation $(3, 1, 2)$ of the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$, the inversions are $(3, 1)$ and $(3, 2)$.

4. **Average Number of Inversions**:
    - For each pair $(i, j)$ with $i < j$, the pair $(p_i, p_j)$ can either be in the correct order or be an inversion.
    - Across all permutations, the number of times $(p_i, p_j)$ is an inversion is equal to the number of times it is not an inversion.
    - Therefore, for each pair $(i, j)$ with $i < j$, the expected number of inversions is $1/2$.

5. **Total Number of Pairs**:
    - The total number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $i < j$ in a set of $n$ elements is $\binom{n}{2}$.

6. **Calculating Total Number of Inversions**:
    - Since each pair $(i, j)$ with $i < j$ is an inversion half of the time on average across all permutations, the total number of inversions in all permutations is:
    $$
    \text{Total Inversions} = \frac{1}{2} \times \binom{n}{2} \times n!
    $$
    - Simplifying this:
    $$
    \text{Total Inversions} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times n!
    $$
    $$
    \text{Total Inversions} = \frac{n(n-1)}{4} \times n!
    $$

    Therefore, the total number of inversions in all permutations of the set $N_n$ is:
    $$
    \boxed{\frac{n(n-1)}{4} \times n!}
    $$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Calculating the total number of permutations of a set.
