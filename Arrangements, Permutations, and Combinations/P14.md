# Problem
Given $n \geq 3$ points in the plane, such that no three of them belong to the same line, how many lines are determined by these points?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of lines that can be formed by $n$ points in the plane, given that no three points are collinear.

2. **Pairwise Selection of Points**:
    - A line is uniquely determined by any pair of points.
    - Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to select 2 points out of $n$.

3. **Use Combinatorial Formula**:
    - The number of ways to choose 2 points from $n$ is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
    $$

Therefore, the number of lines determined by $n$ points in the plane, where no three points are collinear, is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose pairs of points.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{2}$ to calculate the number of pairs.
3. **Line Determination**: Understanding that a line is uniquely defined by any two points.
