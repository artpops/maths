# Problem
How many $n$-arrangements of the elements 0 and 1 are there, such that no two adjacent terms in each of them are both equal to 1?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of binary strings of length $n$ where no two 1's are adjacent.

2. **Define the Problem**:
    - Let $a_n$ represent the number of valid $n$-arrangements of 0's and 1's.

3. **Base Cases**:
    - For $n = 1$, the valid strings are: `0`, `1`. So, $a_1 = 2$.
    - For $n = 2$, the valid strings are: `00`, `01`, `10`. So, $a_2 = 3$.

4. **Recursive Relation**:
    - Consider the valid strings of length $n$:
        - If the string ends with `0`, the preceding $(n-1)$ characters can be any valid string of length $(n-1)$. There are $a_{n-1}$ such strings.
        - If the string ends with `1`, the preceding character must be `0` (to avoid two adjacent 1's), and the first $(n-2)$ characters can be any valid string of length $(n-2)$. There are $a_{n-2}$ such strings.
    - Therefore, the recursive relation is:
    $$
    a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}
    $$

5. **Calculate for General $n$**:
    - Using the base cases and the recursive relation, we can compute $a_n$ for any $n$.

6. **Example Calculation**:
    - Calculate up to $n=5$ for illustration:
        - $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$
        - $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$
        - $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$
    - This follows the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one position.

Therefore, the number of $n$-arrangements of the elements 0 and 1 such that no two adjacent terms in each of them are both equal to 1 is given by the $(n+1)$-th Fibonacci number, where the Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, and $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 3$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The problem reduces to counting valid sequences using a modified Fibonacci sequence.
2. **Recursive Relations**: Understanding how to build the solution recursively from smaller subproblems.
3. **Base Cases**: Establishing initial conditions to start the recursive computation.
