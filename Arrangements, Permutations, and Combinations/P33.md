# Problem
How many 3-combinations $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ of elements $1, 2, \ldots, 3n$ are there, such that $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$ is divisible by 3?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$ such that their sum is divisible by 3.

2. **Residues Modulo 3**:
    - Consider the residues of numbers modulo 3. Each number from 1 to $3n$ will have a residue of 0, 1, or 2.
    - The residues modulo 3 will be evenly distributed among the numbers 1 to $3n$:
        - There will be $n$ numbers with residue 0.
        - There will be $n$ numbers with residue 1.
        - There will be $n$ numbers with residue 2.

3. **Valid Combinations**:
    - We need to find combinations of residues that sum to 0 modulo 3:
        - (0, 0, 0): All three numbers have residue 0.
        - (1, 1, 1): All three numbers have residue 1.
        - (2, 2, 2): All three numbers have residue 2.
        - (0, 1, 2): One number from each residue.

4. **Count Each Type of Combination**:
    - **(0, 0, 0)**:
        - Number of ways to choose 3 from $n$ numbers with residue 0:
        $$
        \binom{n}{3}
        $$
    - **(1, 1, 1)**:
        - Number of ways to choose 3 from $n$ numbers with residue 1:
        $$
        \binom{n}{3}
        $$
    - **(2, 2, 2)**:
        - Number of ways to choose 3 from $n$ numbers with residue 2:
        $$
        \binom{n}{3}
        $$
    - **(0, 1, 2)**:
        - Number of ways to choose 1 from each residue class:
        $$
        \binom{n}{1} \times \binom{n}{1} \times \binom{n}{1} = n^3
        $$

5. **Total Number of Valid Combinations**:
    - Add up all the valid combinations:
    $$
    \binom{n}{3} + \binom{n}{3} + \binom{n}{3} + n^3 = 3 \binom{n}{3} + n^3
    $$

6. **Simplify the Expression**:
    - Recall the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{3}$:
    $$
    \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
    $$
    - Therefore, the total number of valid combinations is:
    $$
    3 \left(\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\right) + n^3 = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + n^3
    $$

Therefore, the number of 3-combinations $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ of elements $1, 2, \ldots, 3n$ such that $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$ is divisible by 3 is $\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + n^3$.
