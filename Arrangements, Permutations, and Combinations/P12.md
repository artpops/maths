# Problem
How many ways can eight white chess pieces (the king, the queen, two rooks, two knights, and two bishops) be arranged on the first row of a chessboard?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to arrange 8 distinct chess pieces with some pieces being identical (2 rooks, 2 knights, and 2 bishops).

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**:
    - If all 8 pieces were distinct, the total number of arrangements would be $8!$.
    - However, since there are identical pieces, we need to account for the repeated arrangements of these identical pieces.
    - The number of arrangements accounting for the identical pieces is:
    $$
    \frac{8!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!}
    $$

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
    - Calculate $8!$:
    $$
    8! = 40320
    $$
    - Calculate $2!$:
    $$
    2! = 2
    $$
    - Calculate the total number of unique arrangements:
    $$
    \frac{8!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \frac{40320}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{40320}{8} = 5040
    $$

Therefore, there are 5040 ways to arrange the eight white chess pieces on the first row of a chessboard.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items where the order matters.
2. **Factorials**: Using $8!$ to count the total number of permutations.
3. **Dividing by Factorials of Identical Items**: Correcting for overcounting arrangements of identical items by dividing by $2!$ for each pair of identical pieces.
