# Problem
Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be nonnegative integers. Prove that
$$
a_1! a_2! \cdots a_n! \leq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)!
$$

# Step-by-Step Proof

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to prove that the product of the factorials of a set of nonnegative integers is less than or equal to the factorial of the sum of these integers.

2. **Multinomial Coefficient**:
    - Consider the multinomial coefficient, which is given by:
    $$
    \binom{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n} = \frac{(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)!}{a_1! a_2! \cdots a_n!}
    $$
    - This multinomial coefficient represents the number of ways to partition a set of $(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)$ objects into $n$ groups of sizes $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

3. **Non-Negative Property**:
    - The multinomial coefficient is always a non-negative integer. This implies that:
    $$
    \binom{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n} \geq 1
    $$

4. **Rearranging the Inequality**:
    - Using the property of the multinomial coefficient, we can write:
    $$
    \frac{(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)!}{a_1! a_2! \cdots a_n!} \geq 1
    $$
    - Rearranging this inequality gives us:
    $$
    (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)! \geq a_1! a_2! \cdots a_n!
    $$

5. **Conclusion**:
    - Hence, we have proven that the product of the factorials of nonnegative integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is less than or equal to the factorial of their sum.

Therefore, we have shown that:
$$
a_1! a_2! \cdots a_n! \leq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)!
$$
