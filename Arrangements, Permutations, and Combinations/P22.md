# Problem
Twelve knights are arranged around King Arthur's Round Table. All of them are quarreling with their neighbors. How many ways can King Arthur choose five knights such that no two of them are quarreling?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to select 5 knights from 12 such that no two selected knights are adjacent. 

2. **Place the Knights**:
    - We can think of placing the knights in such a way that each chosen knight has at least one non-chosen knight between them.
    - Because the knights are in a circle, the arrangement becomes more complex compared to a linear arrangement.

3. **Using Gap Representation**:
    - We need to place 5 knights such that there are gaps between them.
    - After choosing 5 positions for knights, there will be 7 positions left for non-chosen knights, forming gaps between the chosen knights.

4. **Circular Permutations**:
    - To solve this, we can break the circle at any point and consider it as a linear sequence.
    - This means we treat the 12 positions as a sequence, select 5 positions out of 12 such that no two chosen positions are adjacent, then divide by 12 to account for the circular symmetry.

5. **Formulation**:
    - Consider the sequence as a linear one with one knight fixed.
    - Place 5 knights in the 12 positions such that there are gaps between them. We use stars and bars method or combinatorial approach:
    - Choose 5 gaps for the knights, and we are left with 7 positions for the gaps (each chosen knight has at least one gap).

6. **Combination Calculation**:
    - We need to choose 5 gaps for 7 positions. This can be represented as combinations:
    $$
    \binom{7}{5} = \binom{7}{2}
    $$
    - Calculate the combinations:
    $$
    \binom{7}{2} = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = 21
    $$
    - Since the knights are arranged in a circle, we divide by 12 to remove equivalent rotational arrangements.

Therefore, the number of ways King Arthur can choose five knights such that no two of them are quarreling is:
$$
\frac{21}{12} = \approx 1.75
$$
However, the exact answer is derived by considering unique distribution of gaps and knights.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets.
2. **Circular Permutations**: Arranging items in a circle where rotations are considered identical.
3. **Constraints**: Ensuring that the chosen knights meet the specified requirements (no two knights are adjacent).
