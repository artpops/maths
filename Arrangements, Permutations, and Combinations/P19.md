# Problem
Peter has 12 relatives (five men and seven women), and his wife also has 12 relatives (five women and seven men). They do not have common relatives. They decide to invite 12 guests, six each of their relatives, such that there are six men and six women among the guests. How many ways can they choose 12 guests?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - Peter has 5 men and 7 women among his relatives.
    - His wife has 7 men and 5 women among her relatives.
    - They need to invite 6 men and 6 women in total, with 6 relatives from Peter's side and 6 from his wife's side.

2. **Selecting 6 Men and 6 Women**:
    - Let's break this problem into two parts: selecting men and selecting women.

3. **Selecting 6 Men**:
    - We need to choose a combination of men from Peter's and his wife's relatives.
    - Let $k$ be the number of men chosen from Peter's relatives. Then, $6-k$ men are chosen from his wife's relatives.
    - Peter can contribute at most 5 men, and at least 1 man (since we need 6 men in total).

    Therefore, $k$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

    - For each value of $k$, the number of ways to choose $k$ men from Peter's relatives and $6-k$ men from his wife's relatives is:
    $$
    \binom{5}{k} \times \binom{7}{6-k}
    $$

4. **Selecting 6 Women**:
    - Similarly, if $k$ men are chosen from Peter's relatives, then $6-k$ women are chosen from his wife's relatives.
    - Peter will then contribute $6-k$ women, and his wife will contribute $k$ women.

    Therefore, the number of ways to choose $6-k$ women from Peter's relatives and $k$ women from his wife's relatives is:
    $$
    \binom{7}{6-k} \times \binom{5}{k}
    $$

5. **Calculate Total Number of Ways**:
    - We sum over all possible values of $k$ from 1 to 5:
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{5} \left( \binom{5}{k} \times \binom{7}{6-k} \times \binom{7}{6-k} \times \binom{5}{k} \right)
    $$

    - Simplify the expression:
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{5} \left( \binom{5}{k}^2 \times \binom{7}{6-k}^2 \right)
    $$

6. **Perform the Calculation**:
    - For $k=1$:
    $$
    \binom{5}{1}^2 \times \binom{7}{5}^2 = 25 \times 21^2 = 25 \times 441 = 11025
    $$
    - For $k=2$:
    $$
    \binom{5}{2}^2 \times \binom{7}{4}^2 = 100 \times 35^2 = 100 \times 1225 = 122500
    $$
    - For $k=3$:
    $$
    \binom{5}{3}^2 \times \binom{7}{3}^2 = 100 \times 35^2 = 100 \times 1225 = 122500
    $$
    - For $k=4$:
    $$
    \binom{5}{4}^2 \times \binom{7}{2}^2 = 25 \times 21^2 = 25 \times 441 = 11025
    $$
    - For $k=5$:
    $$
    \binom{5}{5}^2 \times \binom{7}{1}^2 = 1 \times 7^2 = 1 \times 49 = 49
    $$

    - Sum all the results:
    $$
    11025 + 122500 + 122500 + 11025 + 49 = 267099
    $$

Therefore, there are 267,099 ways to choose 12 guests such that there are six men and six women among the guests.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements.
3. **Combination Constraints**: Ensuring that the chosen groups meet the specified requirements.
