# Problem
How many different words can be obtained by permuting the letters of the word LOCOMOTIVE, such that no two O's are adjacent?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - The word LOCOMOTIVE has 10 letters: L, O, C, O, M, O, T, I, V, E.
    - We need to permute these letters such that no two O's are adjacent.

2. **Count the Total Letters and Occurrences**:
    - Total letters: 10
    - O occurs 3 times.
    - The remaining letters (L, C, M, T, I, V, E) occur once each.

3. **Place the Non-O Letters**:
    - First, place the 7 non-O letters in a sequence. The number of ways to arrange these 7 letters is:
    $$
    7!
    $$

4. **Determine the Gaps**:
    - Placing 7 non-O letters creates 8 gaps (including the ends) where the O's can be placed.

5. **Choose Gaps for the O's**:
    - We need to choose 3 out of these 8 gaps to place the O's such that no two O's are adjacent.
    - The number of ways to choose 3 gaps out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{8}{3}
    $$

6. **Calculate the Total Number of Valid Permutations**:
    - The total number of valid permutations is:
    $$
    7! \times \binom{8}{3}
    $$

7. **Perform the Calculation**:
    - Calculate $7!$:
    $$
    7! = 5040
    $$
    - Calculate $\binom{8}{3}$:
    $$
    \binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
    $$
    - Multiply the results:
    $$
    5040 \times 56 = 282240
    $$

Therefore, the number of different words that can be obtained by permuting the letters of the word LOCOMOTIVE such that no two O's are adjacent is 282,240.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items where the order matters.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements.
3. **Constraints**: Ensuring that the chosen letters meet the specified requirements (no two O's are adjacent).
