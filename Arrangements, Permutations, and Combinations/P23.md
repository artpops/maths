# Problem
How many $n$-digit positive integers $c_1c_2 \ldots c_n$ are there, such that $1 \leq c_1 \leq c_2 \leq \cdots \leq c_n \leq 9$?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of $n$-digit positive integers where the digits are non-decreasing and each digit is between 1 and 9 inclusive.

2. **Mapping the Problem to Combinatorics**:
    - This problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to distribute $n$ identical items (digits) into 9 distinct bins (digits 1 through 9) such that the order of items in each bin matters.
    - This can be formulated using the "stars and bars" theorem in combinatorics.

3. **Using Stars and Bars**:
    - We have $n$ stars (digits) to place into 9 bins (possible digits from 1 to 9).
    - The number of ways to distribute $n$ stars into 9 bins is given by:
    $$
    \binom{n + 9 - 1}{9 - 1} = \binom{n + 8}{8}
    $$

Therefore, the number of $n$-digit positive integers $c_1c_2 \ldots c_n$ such that $1 \leq c_1 \leq c_2 \leq \cdots \leq c_n \leq 9$ is $\binom{n + 8}{8}$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets.
2. **Stars and Bars**: A combinatorial method to distribute $n$ identical items into $k$ distinct bins.
3. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$ to calculate the number of distributions.
