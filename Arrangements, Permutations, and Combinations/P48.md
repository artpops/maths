# Problem
Suppose that $n$ points are given at any side of a square. None of these points coincides with a vertex of the square. How many triangles are determined by these $4n$ points?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We have a square with $n$ points on each of its 4 sides.
    - We need to determine how many triangles can be formed using these $4n$ points.

2. **Total Number of Points**:
    - There are $4n$ points in total.

3. **Selecting 3 Points**:
    - To form a triangle, we need to select 3 points out of these $4n$ points.
    - The number of ways to select 3 points from $4n$ points is given by:
    $$
    \binom{4n}{3}
    $$

4. **Subtracting Collinear Points**:
    - If all 3 points lie on the same side of the square, they cannot form a triangle as they will be collinear.
    - We need to count and subtract such collinear triplets.

5. **Counting Collinear Triplets**:
    - The number of ways to select 3 points out of $n$ points on one side is given by:
    $$
    \binom{n}{3}
    $$
    - Since there are 4 sides, the total number of collinear triplets is:
    $$
    4 \binom{n}{3}
    $$

6. **Total Number of Triangles**:
    - The total number of triangles is given by the total combinations of 3 points minus the collinear triplets:
    $$
    \binom{4n}{3} - 4 \binom{n}{3}
    $$

7. **Calculations**:
    - Calculate $\binom{4n}{3}$:
    $$
    \binom{4n}{3} = \frac{4n (4n - 1) (4n - 2)}{6}
    $$
    - Calculate $4 \binom{n}{3}$:
    $$
    4 \binom{n}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{n (n - 1) (n - 2)}{6}
    $$

8. **Final Expression**:
    - Substitute and simplify:
    $$
    \binom{4n}{3} - 4 \binom{n}{3} = \frac{4n (4n - 1) (4n - 2)}{6} - \frac{4n (n - 1) (n - 2)}{6}
    $$

Therefore, the number of triangles determined by these $4n$ points is:
$$
\binom{4n}{3} - 4 \binom{n}{3}
$$
