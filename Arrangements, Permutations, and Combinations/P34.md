# Problem
Determine the total number of 0's in the decimal representations of the positive integers $1, 2, \ldots, 10^9$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the number of times the digit 0 appears in the numbers from 1 to $10^9$.

2. **Break Down the Problem**:
    - Consider the total number of digits in the range from 1 to $10^9$.
    - Numbers from 1 to $10^9 - 1$ have up to 9 digits, and $10^9$ itself has 10 digits.
    - We need to count the zeros for each place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) separately.

3. **Count Zeros in Each Place**:
    - For each digit place $d$ (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), the number of zeros in that place in the range from 1 to $10^9 - 1$ can be counted using a pattern.

4. **Count Zeros in Units Place**:
    - From 1 to 9: 0 zeros.
    - From 10 to 99: 9 zeros (10, 20, ..., 90).
    - From 100 to 999: 90 zeros (100, 101, ..., 190, 200, ..., 990).
    - In general, for every set of 10 numbers, the units place has 1 zero.
    - Therefore, the total number of zeros in the units place from 1 to $10^9$ is:
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{10^9}{10} \right\rfloor = 10^8
    $$

5. **Count Zeros in Higher Places**:
    - For the tens place, consider the same logic:
    $$
    10, 20, ..., 90 \rightarrow 10 zeros
    $$
    - For each set of 100 numbers, there are 10 zeros in the tens place.
    - Therefore, the total number of zeros in the tens place from 1 to $10^9$ is:
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{10^9}{100} \right\rfloor \times 10 = 10^7 \times 10 = 10^8
    $$

6. **Generalize for Each Digit Place**:
    - For each digit place $k$ (units, tens, hundreds, ...):
    $$
    \left\lfloor \frac{10^9}{10^{k+1}} \right\rfloor \times 10^k = 10^{8-k} \times 10^k = 10^8
    $$

7. **Summing the Zeros**:
    - Since there are 9 digit places (units to $10^9$ place):
    $$
    9 \times 10^8 = 9 \times 100,000,000 = 900,000,000
    $$

Therefore, the total number of 0's in the decimal representations of the positive integers from 1 to $10^9$ is $900,000,000$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Place Value Counting**: Counting the occurrences of digits in each place value.
2. **Patterns in Digits**: Recognizing patterns in the occurrences of zeros.
3. **Summation**: Summing the counts for each place value to get the total.
