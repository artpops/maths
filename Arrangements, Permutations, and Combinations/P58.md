# Problem
For any positive integer \( n \), determine the greatest positive integer \( k \in N_n = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \) with the following property: there exist \( k \) subsets of the set \( N_n \), such that any two of them have a nonempty intersection.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the maximum number \( k \) such that there exist \( k \) subsets of \( N_n \) with a nonempty intersection for every pair of subsets.

2. **Constraints and Conditions**:
    - Each pair of these \( k \) subsets must have at least one element in common.

3. **Constructing the Solution**:
    - To maximize \( k \), we need to carefully construct subsets that guarantee nonempty intersections for every pair.
    - One approach is to consider subsets that all contain at least one common element.

4. **Analyzing Subsets with a Common Element**:
    - Suppose we fix an element, say \( 1 \), and consider all subsets that include \( 1 \).
    - There are \( 2^{n-1} \) such subsets (since each subset can either include or exclude the remaining \( n-1 \) elements).

5. **Maximizing \( k \)**:
    - The largest possible \( k \) is when each subset includes the common element \( 1 \).
    - Therefore, \( k = 2^{n-1} \).

6. **Verification**:
    - Each pair of these \( 2^{n-1} \) subsets includes \( 1 \), ensuring a nonempty intersection.

# Conclusion
The greatest positive integer \( k \in N_n \) with the property that there exist \( k \) subsets of the set \( N_n \) such that any two of them have a nonempty intersection is:
$$
\boxed{2^{n-1}}
$$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Set Theory**: Understanding subsets and their intersections.
2. **Combinatorial Counting**: Counting the number of subsets that include a common element.
3. **Binary Representation**: Using binary choices to construct subsets.
