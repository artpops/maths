# Problem
Let $n \geq 2$. How many permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ are there, such that 2 is placed after 1, not necessarily at adjacent positions?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ where the element 2 is placed after the element 1.

2. **Total Number of Permutations**:
    - The total number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is $n!$.

3. **Consider the Placement of 1 and 2**:
    - In each permutation, the number 1 can appear in any of the $n$ positions, and the number 2 must appear in one of the positions after 1.
    - For each position of 1, there are $(n-1)$ choices for the position of 2 after 1.

4. **Calculate the Number of Valid Permutations**:
    - There are $n$ choices for the position of 1.
    - For each choice of the position of 1, there are $(n-1)$ choices for the position of 2.
    - Therefore, the number of valid permutations is:
    $$
    n \times (n-1)!
    $$

Therefore, the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that 2 is placed after 1, not necessarily at adjacent positions, is $n \times (n-1)!$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items where the order matters.
2. **Counting Principle**: Multiplying the number of choices for each independent event.
3. **Factorials**: Using $n!$ to count the total number of permutations.
