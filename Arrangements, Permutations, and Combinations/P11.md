# Problem
How many permutations $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{3n})$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$ are there, such that, for any $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$, the difference $k - a_k$ is divisible by 3?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$ such that $k - a_k \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ for all $k$ in the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$.
    - This means $k \equiv a_k \pmod{3}$ for all $k$.

2. **Group Elements by Remainders Modulo 3**:
    - Divide the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$ into three subsets based on their remainders when divided by 3:
      - $\{1, 4, 7, \ldots\}$ (elements congruent to 1 mod 3)
      - $\{2, 5, 8, \ldots\}$ (elements congruent to 2 mod 3)
      - $\{3, 6, 9, \ldots\}$ (elements congruent to 0 mod 3)

3. **Permutation within Each Subset**:
    - Each element in one subset must map to an element in the same subset to satisfy the condition $k \equiv a_k \pmod{3}$.
    - There are $n$ elements in each subset.

4. **Calculate the Number of Permutations**:
    - The number of permutations within each subset is $n!$.
    - Since there are three independent subsets, the total number of permutations is:
    $$
    (n!)^3
    $$

Therefore, the number of permutations $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{3n})$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$ such that $k - a_k$ is divisible by 3 for any $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 3n\}$ is $(n!)^3$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using properties of numbers under modulo operation.
2. **Permutations**: Arranging items where the order matters.
3. **Factorials**: Using $n!$ to count the total number of permutations within each subset.
