# Problem
There are $n$ light bulbs in a room, each of them with its own switch. How many ways can the room be lighted?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - Each light bulb can either be on or off.
    - We need to determine the number of possible states for the room's lighting.

2. **Determine the Number of Possible States for Each Light Bulb**:
    - Each light bulb has 2 possible states: on or off.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**:
    - Since each of the $n$ light bulbs can be in 2 states, and the states of the light bulbs are independent, we multiply the number of states for each light bulb.
    - The total number of combinations is:
    $2^n$

Therefore, there are $2^n$ ways to light the room.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Binary Choices**: Each light bulb can be either on or off, representing two states.
2. **Exponentiation**: The total number of combinations is given by raising the number of choices to the power of the number of items.
