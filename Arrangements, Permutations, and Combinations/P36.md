# Problem
Determine the sum of all digits that appear in the decimal representations of all positive integers from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 1,000,000\}$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the sum of all digits that appear in the numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.

2. **Count the Occurrences of Each Digit in Each Place**:
    - Each number has 7 digits (including leading zeros if necessary).
    - We need to find the sum of digits in each place (units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions).

3. **Units Place**:
    - The units place cycles through 0 to 9 for every 10 numbers.
    - In 1 to 1,000,000, there are $100,000$ groups of 10 numbers.
    - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears $100,000$ times in the units place.
    - Sum of digits 0 to 9 is $0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 9 = 45$.
    - Therefore, the sum of digits in the units place is $100,000 \times 45 = 4,500,000$.

4. **Tens Place**:
    - The tens place cycles through 0 to 9 for every 100 numbers.
    - In 1 to 1,000,000, there are $10,000$ groups of 100 numbers.
    - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears $10,000 \times 10 = 100,000$ times in the tens place.
    - Sum of digits in the tens place is also $4,500,000$.

5. **Higher Places**:
    - By similar logic, for hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, and hundred thousands places, the sum of digits is $4,500,000$ for each place.

6. **Millions Place**:
    - The digit in the millions place can only be 1, appearing exactly once.
    - Sum of digits in the millions place is $1$.

7. **Total Sum**:
    - Sum of digits in units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, and hundred thousands places is:
    $$
    4,500,000 \times 6 = 27,000,000
    $$
    - Adding the sum for the millions place:
    $$
    27,000,000 + 1 = 27,000,001
    $$

Therefore, the sum of all digits that appear in the decimal representations of all positive integers from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 1,000,000\}$ is $27,000,001$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Place Value Counting**: Counting the occurrences of digits in each place value.
2. **Summation**: Summing the counts for each place value to get the total.
