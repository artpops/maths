# Problem
How many ways can $n$ people sit around a circular table, if the chairs are not labeled?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of distinct ways to arrange $n$ people around a circular table, considering that rotations of the same arrangement are not distinct.

2. **Fixing One Person to Break Symmetry**:
    - To avoid counting rotations as different arrangements, we can fix one person in one chair. This breaks the rotational symmetry.
    - After fixing one person, we have $(n-1)$ people left to arrange in the remaining $(n-1)$ chairs.

3. **Calculate the Number of Arrangements**:
    - The number of ways to arrange $(n-1)$ people in $(n-1)$ chairs is $(n-1)!$.

Therefore, the number of ways $n$ people can sit around a circular table, if the chairs are not labeled, is $(n-1)!$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Circular Permutations**: Arranging items in a circle where rotations are considered identical.
2. **Factorials**: Using $(n-1)!$ to count the total number of distinct circular permutations.
3. **Breaking Symmetry**: Fixing one item to account for rotational symmetry and avoid overcounting.
