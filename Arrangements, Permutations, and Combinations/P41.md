# Problem
According to the rules, a set of a volleyball game is won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage. After each point the result is written down, for example 0:1, 0:2, 1:2, 2:2, .... The first integer always shows points scored by the host team. Suppose that the final result of a set is 25:n. How many ways can this result be reached,
(a) if $n \in \{0,1,2,\ldots,23\}$ is a fixed integer?
(b) if we know only that $n \leq 23$?

# Step-by-Step Solution

## Part (a): Fixed Integer $n \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 23\}$

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - The game is won by the host team with a score of 25 while the guest team has a score of $n$ where $n$ is fixed between 0 and 23.

2. **Total Points Before Reaching 24:24**:
    - The total points scored before the host team reaches 24 points is $24 + n$.

3. **Ways to Reach 24:24**:
    - We need to choose 24 points out of the total $24+n$ points to be scored by the host team. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{24+n}{24}
    $$

4. **Final Point to Win the Game**:
    - After reaching 24:24, the host team needs to score 1 more point to reach 25 and win the game. This is always 1 way since the host team must win the 25th point.

5. **Total Ways for Fixed $n$**:
    - Therefore, the total number of ways to reach the final score 25:$n$ for a fixed $n$ is:
    $$
    \binom{24+n}{24}
    $$

## Part (b): $n \leq 23$

1. **Sum Over All Possible Values of $n$**:
    - To find the total number of ways for any $n \leq 23$, sum the ways for each possible value of $n$ from 0 to 23.

2. **Total Ways for All $n \leq 23$**:
    $$
    \sum_{n=0}^{23} \binom{24+n}{24}
    $$

3. **Simplifying the Sum**:
    - This sum can be recognized as a known combinatorial identity. The sum of binomial coefficients over the range from $n = 0$ to $n = k$ for a fixed $r$ is given by:
    $$
    \sum_{n=0}^{k} \binom{r+n}{r} = \binom{r+k+1}{r+1}
    $$
    - In our case, $r = 24$ and $k = 23$, so:
    $$
    \sum_{n=0}^{23} \binom{24+n}{24} = \binom{24+23+1}{24+1} = \binom{48}{25}
    $$

Therefore, the number of ways to reach the final score of 25:$n$ is $\binom{24+n}{24}$ for a fixed $n \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 23\}$, and the total number of ways to reach a final score of 25:$n$ for any $n \leq 23$ is $\binom{48}{25}$.
