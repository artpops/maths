# Problem
How many positive integers are there in the set $S = \{1, 2, \ldots, 10^7\}$, such that the digit 1 does not appear in their decimal representations?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count how many integers from 1 to $10^7$ do not contain the digit 1.

2. **Total Number of Integers**:
    - The set $S$ contains the integers from 1 to $10^7$, which means there are $10^7$ integers.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
    - Each digit of the number must be any of the digits 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
    - Since the number must not contain the digit 1, there are 9 choices for each digit.

4. **Digits in Each Place**:
    - For a 7-digit number, there are 9 possible choices (0, 2-9) for each of the 7 positions.
    - However, for the first digit (most significant digit), it cannot be 0. So, there are only 8 choices for the first digit.

5. **Calculate the Number of Valid 7-Digit Numbers**:
    - For the first digit: 8 choices (2-9)
    - For each of the remaining 6 digits: 9 choices (0, 2-9)

    Therefore, the total number of valid 7-digit numbers is:
    $$
    8 \times 9^6
    $$

6. **Calculate the Number of Valid Numbers with Fewer Digits**:
    - For numbers with 1 to 6 digits, each digit can be any of 9 choices (0, 2-9).
    - For a k-digit number where $1 \leq k \leq 6$:
    $$
    9^k
    $$

7. **Sum the Total Valid Numbers**:
    - Add the valid numbers for each length (1 to 7 digits):
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{6} 9^k + 8 \times 9^6
    $$

    Simplifying the summation:
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{6} 9^k = 9 + 9^2 + 9^3 + 9^4 + 9^5 + 9^6 = 9 \times \frac{9^6 - 1}{9 - 1} = 9 \times \frac{531441 - 1}{8} = 9 \times 66430 = 597870
    $$

    Adding the 7-digit numbers:
    $$
    597870 + 8 \times 531441 = 597870 + 4251528 = 4849398
    $$

Therefore, the number of positive integers in the set $S = \{1, 2, \ldots, 10^7\}$ such that the digit 1 does not appear in their decimal representations is $4849398$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of valid combinations of digits.
2. **Geometric Series**: Summing the powers of a constant base.
3. **Constraints**: Ensuring that numbers do not contain the digit 1.
