# Problem 
Suppose that $2n$ points are located on a circle. How many ways can these $2n$ points be connected into $n$ pairs by $n$ chords without points of intersection inside the circle?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to connect $2n$ points on a circle into $n$ pairs using $n$ chords.
    - The chords should not intersect inside the circle.

2. **Catalan Number**:
    - The problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to connect $2n$ points on a circle with $n$ non-crossing chords.
    - This is a well-known combinatorial problem, and the number of such configurations is given by the $n$-th Catalan number, $C_n$.

3. **Formula for Catalan Number**:
    - The $n$-th Catalan number is given by:
    - $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$

4. **Result**:
    - The number of ways to connect $2n$ points into $n$ pairs without intersections inside the circle is:
    - $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$
