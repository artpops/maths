# Problem
Suppose that there are $2n + 1$ distinct books and $n$ more books of the same kind. How many ways can we buy $n$ books?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We have a total of $2n + 1$ distinct books.
    - There are also $n$ identical books.
    - We need to determine the number of ways to buy $n$ books in total.

2. **Case Analysis**:
    - We can buy $k$ distinct books and $n-k$ identical books.
    - The possible values for $k$ range from $0$ to $n$.

3. **Counting the Ways**:
    - If we choose $k$ distinct books from $2n + 1$ distinct books, the number of ways to do this is given by $\binom{2n + 1}{k}$.
    - The remaining $n - k$ books must be the identical ones.
    - For each $k$, we sum the combinations.

4. **Total Number of Ways**:
    - The total number of ways to choose $n$ books is the sum of all possible combinations for each $k$:
    $$
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{2n + 1}{k}
    $$

    This summation can be simplified using the binomial theorem.

    By the binomial theorem, the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given $n$ is:
    $$
    \sum_{k=0}^{2n+1} \binom{2n + 1}{k} = 2^{2n+1}
    $$

    Since we are summing only up to $n$, we can use the symmetry property of binomial coefficients:
    $$
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{2n + 1}{k} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{2n+1} \binom{2n + 1}{k} \right)
    $$
    Thus,
    $$
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{2n + 1}{k} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^{2n+1} = 2^{2n}
    $$

    Therefore, the total number of ways to choose $n$ books is:
    $$
    \boxed{2^{2n}}
    $$
