# Problem
Prove that the product of $k$ consecutive positive integers is divisible by $k!$.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to prove that the product of any $k$ consecutive integers is divisible by $k!$.

2. **Express the Product of $k$ Consecutive Integers**:
    - Let $n$ be any positive integer. Consider the $k$ consecutive integers starting from $n$:
    $$
    n, (n+1), (n+2), \ldots, (n+k-1)
    $$
    - The product of these integers is:
    $$
    P = n(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+k-1)
    $$

3. **Combination Representation**:
    - Consider the binomial coefficient $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. It is defined as:
    $$
    \binom{n+k-1}{k} = \frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!}
    $$
    - Rearrange the numerator:
    $$
    (n+k-1)(n+k-2)\cdots n = \frac{(n+k-1)!}{(n-1)!}
    $$
    - Therefore:
    $$
    \binom{n+k-1}{k} = \frac{(n+k-1)(n+k-2)\cdots n}{k!}
    $$
    - This shows that the product of $k$ consecutive integers is equal to $\binom{n+k-1}{k} \cdot k!$.

4. **Divisibility by $k!$**:
    - Since $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ is always an integer, the product of $k$ consecutive integers $(n, n+1, n+2, \ldots, n+k-1)$ is divisible by $k!$.

5. **Conclusion**:
    - Hence, we have shown that the product of any $k$ consecutive positive integers is divisible by $k!$.

Therefore, the product of $k$ consecutive positive integers is divisible by $k!$.
