# Problem
Twelve books are arranged in a sequence. How many ways can five books be chosen such that no two of them are adjacent in the sequence?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to choose 5 books out of 12 arranged in a sequence such that no two chosen books are adjacent.

2. **Placing the Books**:
    - We need to place 5 books such that they are not adjacent. This means there must be at least one book between any two chosen books.
    - Consider the gaps between the chosen books. We need to have at least 4 gaps to separate the 5 chosen books.

3. **Effective Arrangement**:
    - To ensure no two books are adjacent, we can represent the sequence of 12 books with X's and gaps with O's. We need to place 5 X's and 7 O's in a sequence.
    - We need to arrange these 7 gaps (O's) in the remaining 7 positions of the 12 book sequence.

4. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Arrange**:
    - We first place the 5 books in a sequence which creates 6 gaps around them (before, between, and after the books).
    - Out of these 6 gaps, we need to choose 4 gaps to place the remaining 7 gaps (O's).
    - This problem can be converted into placing 7 books in 12 gaps which leads to:
    - Using the combinatorial formula for choosing 7 positions out of 12:
    $$
    \binom{8}{3}
    $$

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 5 books such that no two of them are adjacent in the sequence is $\binom{8}{3}$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements.
3. **Constraints**: Ensuring that the chosen books meet the specified requirements (no two books are adjacent).
