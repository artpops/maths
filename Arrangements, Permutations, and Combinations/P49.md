# Problem
Suppose that $n \geq 2$ lines are given in the plane. Let us assume that $k \geq 2$ points are chosen at any of these lines such that the following two conditions are satisfied.
1. None of these points coincides with a point of intersection of the given lines.
2. No three of these points belong to the same line which does not coincide with one of the given lines.
How many triangles are determined by the given points?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We have $n$ lines and $k$ points on these lines.
    - Points do not coincide with intersections of the lines.
    - No three points are collinear on the same line which is not one of the given lines.

2. **Selecting 3 Points**:
    - To form a triangle, we need to select 3 points out of these $nk$ points.
    - The number of ways to select 3 points from $nk$ points is given by:
    $$
    \binom{nk}{3}
    $$

3. **Conditions for Forming Triangles**:
    - The problem ensures that no three points are collinear unless they are on the given lines, so we can use the total combinations without further reduction.

4. **Total Number of Triangles**:
    - Given that no three points chosen will be collinear unless they lie on one of the given lines, and considering that points do not coincide with intersection points, we directly calculate the number of triangles:
    $$
    \binom{nk}{3}
    $$

5. **Final Expression**:
    - Substitute and simplify:
    $$
    \binom{nk}{3} = \frac{nk (nk - 1) (nk - 2)}{6}
    $$

Therefore, the number of triangles determined by the given points is:
$$
\binom{nk}{3}
$$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combination Formula**: Calculating combinations using $\binom{n}{r}$.
2. **Collinear Points Condition**: Ensuring no three points are collinear on a non-given line.
3. **Simplification**: Simplifying the final expression to find the total number of triangles.
