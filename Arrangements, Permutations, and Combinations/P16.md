# Problem
Given a convex $n$-gon, such that no two lines determined by the vertices of the $n$-gon are parallel, and no three of them intersect at the same point, determine the number of points of intersection of these lines that are:
(a) inside the $n$-gon;
(b) outside the $n$-gon.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the number of intersection points formed by the diagonals of a convex $n$-gon that are inside and outside the $n$-gon.

2. **Total Number of Intersection Points**:
    - Any pair of diagonals in a convex $n$-gon intersects at a unique point.
    - To find the total number of intersection points formed by the diagonals, we need to choose 4 vertices (since a pair of diagonals is uniquely determined by 4 vertices) out of $n$. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{n}{4} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}
    $$

3. **Number of Intersection Points Inside the $n$-gon**:
    - All intersection points of the diagonals of a convex $n$-gon lie inside the $n$-gon.
    - Therefore, the number of intersection points inside the $n$-gon is:
    $$
    \binom{n}{4} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}
    $$

4. **Number of Intersection Points Outside the $n$-gon**:
    - Since all intersection points of the diagonals of a convex $n$-gon lie inside the $n$-gon, the number of intersection points outside the $n$-gon is:
    $$
    0
    $$

Therefore, the number of points of intersection of these lines that are:
(a) inside the $n$-gon is $\binom{n}{4} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}$;
(b) outside the $n$-gon is $0$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose sets of vertices.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{4}$ to calculate the number of intersection points of diagonals.
3. **Properties of Convex Polygons**: Understanding that all intersection points of diagonals in a convex polygon lie inside the polygon.
