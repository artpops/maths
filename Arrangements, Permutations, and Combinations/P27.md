# Problem
A box contains 36 yellow, 27 blue, 18 green, and 9 red balls. Balls of the same color are indistinguishable. How many ways are there to choose 10 balls from the box?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to choose 10 balls from a collection of balls of four different colors (yellow, blue, green, and red) where balls of the same color are indistinguishable.

2. **Using Stars and Bars Method**:
    - This problem can be translated to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:
    $$
    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10
    $$
    - Where $x_1$ is the number of yellow balls, $x_2$ is the number of blue balls, $x_3$ is the number of green balls, and $x_4$ is the number of red balls.

3. **Calculate the Number of Solutions**:
    - The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10$ is given by the stars and bars theorem:
    $$
    \binom{10 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \binom{13}{3}
    $$

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
    - Calculate $\binom{13}{3}$:
    $$
    \binom{13}{3} = \frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 286
    $$

Therefore, there are 286 ways to choose 10 balls from the box.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets.
2. **Stars and Bars**: A combinatorial method to distribute $n$ identical items into $k$ distinct bins.
3. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of distributions.
