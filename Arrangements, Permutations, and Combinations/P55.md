# Problem
Determine the greatest possible number of permutations of an $n$-set $A$, such that any two elements of $A$ are adjacent in at most one of these permutations.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the maximum number of permutations of a set $A$ with $n$ elements such that any pair of elements is adjacent in at most one permutation.

2. **Total Number of Permutations**:
    - The total number of permutations of the set $A$ is $n!$.

3. **Adjacent Pairs**:
    - In each permutation of $A$, there are $n-1$ pairs of adjacent elements.
    - We need to ensure that each pair of elements is adjacent in at most one permutation.

4. **Counting Adjacent Pairs**:
    - The number of possible pairs of elements in a set of $n$ elements is $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
    - Since each permutation has $n-1$ pairs of adjacent elements, we want to distribute these pairs across the permutations without repeating any pair more than once.

5. **Maximizing Permutations**:
    - Let $k$ be the number of permutations. In these $k$ permutations, there are $k(n-1)$ pairs of adjacent elements.
    - Each of the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs must be counted exactly once across these $k$ permutations.

6. **Inequality**:
    - We need $k(n-1) \leq \binom{n}{2}$.
    - Substituting $\binom{n}{2}$ gives us: $k(n-1) \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
    - Simplifying, we get: $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$.

7. **Solution**:
    - Therefore, the maximum number of permutations $k$ is $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$.

# Conclusion
The greatest possible number of permutations of an $n$-set $A$, such that any two elements of $A$ are adjacent in at most one of these permutations, is:
$$
\boxed{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}
$$
