# Problem
How many 3-digit positive integers are there, such that three distinct digits appear in the decimal representation of any of them?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find 3-digit numbers where all three digits are distinct.
    - A 3-digit number ranges from 100 to 999.

2. **Determine the Range of Digits**:
    - The hundreds place (first digit) can range from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0).
    - The tens place (second digit) and units place (third digit) can range from 0 to 9 but must be distinct from each other and the first digit.

3. **Calculate the Number of Choices for Each Digit**:
    - **Hundreds place**: 9 choices (1 to 9).
    - **Tens place**: 9 choices (0 to 9 except the digit chosen for the hundreds place).
    - **Units place**: 8 choices (0 to 9 except the digits chosen for the hundreds and tens places).

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**:
    - Number of ways to choose the digits is given by multiplying the number of choices for each place:  
    $9 \text{ (hundreds place)} \times 9 \text{ (tens place)} \times 8 \text{ (units place)} = 9 \times 9 \times 8 = 648$

Therefore, there are 648 three-digit positive integers with three distinct digits.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items (digits) where the order matters.
2. **Counting Principle**: Multiplying the number of choices for each independent event.
3. **Constraints**: Ensuring digits are distinct and within the range for each place value in a 3-digit number.
