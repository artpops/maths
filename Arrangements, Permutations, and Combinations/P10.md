# Problem
Let $n \geq k + 2$. How many permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ are there, such that exactly $k$ elements appear between 1 and 2?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to count the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ where exactly $k$ elements appear between 1 and 2.

2. **Choose Positions for 1 and 2**:
    - To have exactly $k$ elements between 1 and 2, the positions of 1 and 2 must be separated by $k + 1$ positions. 
    - For example, if 1 is at position $i$, then 2 must be at position $i + k + 1$ or vice versa.

3. **Count the Number of Valid Position Pairs**:
    - The positions $(i, i+k+1)$ must satisfy $1 \leq i \leq n - (k + 1)$. There are $(n - k - 1)$ possible values for $i$.
    - Since 1 and 2 can be in either order, we multiply by 2.

4. **Permutations of the Remaining Elements**:
    - The remaining $n-2$ elements can be permuted in $(n-2)!$ ways.

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Permutations**:
    - The total number of permutations is:
    $$
    2 \times (n - k - 1) \times (n - 2)!
    $$

Therefore, the number of permutations of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that exactly $k$ elements appear between 1 and 2 is $2 \times (n - k - 1) \times (n - 2)!$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Permutations**: Arranging items where the order matters.
2. **Counting Principle**: Multiplying the number of choices for each independent event.
3. **Factorials**: Using $(n-2)!$ to count the total number of permutations of the remaining elements.
4. **Constraints**: Ensuring the positions of 1 and 2 allow exactly $k$ elements to be between them.
