# Problem
How many positive integers less than $10^n$ are there, such that no two adjacent digits in their decimal representations are equal to each other?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of positive integers with up to $n$ digits such that no two adjacent digits are the same.

2. **Set Up the Problem**:
    - Let's denote the number of valid $n$-digit integers as $A_n$.
    - We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Define $dp[d][j]$ as the number of $d$-digit integers ending with digit $j$.
    - The digit $j$ can be any from 0 to 9, but the first digit (most significant) cannot be 0 for positive integers.

4. **Initialization**:
    - For 1-digit integers (base case), $dp[1][j] = 1$ for $j$ from 1 to 9 (since a 1-digit integer can be any digit from 1 to 9).
    - For 1-digit integers ending in 0, $dp[1][0] = 0$.

5. **Transition**:
    - For $d$ from 2 to $n$ (number of digits):
      - For each digit $j$ from 0 to 9:
        - $dp[d][j] = \sum_{k=0, k \neq j}^{9} dp[d-1][k]$
    - This ensures that the current digit $j$ is not the same as the previous digit $k$.

6. **Final Count**:
    - The total number of valid $n$-digit integers is:
      $$
      A_n = \sum_{j=1}^{9} dp[n][j]
      $$
    - This sum starts from 1 to 9 because the first digit cannot be 0.

7. **Calculation**:
    - Initialize $dp$ table for 1-digit integers:
      - $dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = \cdots = dp[1][9] = 1$
      - $dp[1][0] = 0$
    - For $d$ from 2 to $n$:
      - For each $j$ from 0 to 9:
        - $dp[d][j] = \sum_{k=0, k \neq j}^{9} dp[d-1][k]$

8. **Sum Up**:
    - After filling the $dp$ table, sum up the values for $n$-digit numbers:
      $$
      A_n = \sum_{j=1}^{9} dp[n][j]
      $$

9. **Example**:
    - For $n=2$, calculate manually:
      - Valid numbers: 12, 13, 14, ..., 21, 23, 24, ..., 91, 92, ..., 98
      - Total: $81$ (since each of the $9$ first digits can be followed by $9$ other digits).

Therefore, the number of positive integers less than $10^n$ such that no two adjacent digits are equal to each other can be computed using dynamic programming.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
2. **Transition Relation**: Ensuring no two adjacent digits are the same.
3. **Summation**: Summing the counts for valid numbers.
