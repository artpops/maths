# Problem
Let \( N_n = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \) and \( k \in \mathbb{N} \). For any \( j \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n\} \), determine how many \( k \)-tuples \((A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k)\) there are, such that the following conditions are satisfied: \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k \subseteq N_n \), and \(|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_k| = j \).

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of \( k \)-tuples of subsets of \( N_n \) such that the intersection of all \( k \) subsets has exactly \( j \) elements.

2. **Selecting the Common Elements**:
    - We first select \( j \) elements from \( N_n \) that will be in the intersection of all \( k \) sets. The number of ways to choose \( j \) elements from \( n \) elements is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{n}{j}
    $$

3. **Remaining Elements**:
    - The remaining \( n - j \) elements need to be distributed among the \( k \) sets. For each of the remaining \( n - j \) elements, there are \( 2^k - 1 \) ways to assign it to the \( k \) sets such that it does not belong to the intersection of all \( k \) sets.

4. **Total Count**:
    - The total number of ways to distribute the \( n - j \) elements among the \( k \) sets is:
    $$
    (2^k - 1)^{n - j}
    $$

5. **Combining Both Steps**:
    - The total number of \( k \)-tuples satisfying the given conditions is the product of the number of ways to choose the \( j \) elements for the intersection and the number of ways to distribute the remaining elements:
    $$
    \binom{n}{j} (2^k - 1)^{n - j}
    $$

# Conclusion
The number of \( k \)-tuples \((A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k)\) such that \(|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_k| = j\) is given by:
$$
\binom{n}{j} (2^k - 1)^{n - j}
$$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Binomial Coefficient**: Counting the number of ways to choose \( j \) elements from \( n \) elements.
2. **Combinatorial Distribution**: Distributing elements into subsets with specific constraints.
