# Problem
All digits 0, 1, .... , 9 are written down on a sheet of paper. After a 180° rotation, the digits 0, 1, and 8 do not change meaning, the digit 6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6. The remaining digits lose their meaning. How many 7-digit positive integers are there, such that they remain the same after the 180° rotation?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find 7-digit numbers that remain unchanged after a 180° rotation.
    - The valid digits are 0, 1, 8, 6, and 9. The digits 6 and 9 will swap positions upon rotation.

2. **Form the Number**:
    - For a 7-digit number to remain the same after a 180° rotation, it must be a palindrome where 6 and 9 swap and 0, 1, 8 remain the same.

3. **Identify Palindromic Structure**:
    - A 7-digit palindromic number has the form: $a_1a_2a_3a_4a_3a_2a_1$
    - The first and last digits, second and second-last digits, and so on must follow the symmetry rules.
    - Therefore, $a_1$ can be 1, 6, 8, or 9 (since it can't be 0 for a 7-digit number).

4. **Choices for Each Position**:
    - $a_1$: 1, 6, 8, 9 (4 choices)
    - $a_2$: 0, 1, 8, 6, 9 (5 choices)
    - $a_3$: 0, 1, 8, 6, 9 (5 choices)
    - $a_4$: 0, 1, 8 (3 choices)

5. **Count the Total Combinations**:
    - Total number of valid 7-digit numbers:
    $$
    4 \times 5 \times 5 \times 3 = 300
    $$

Therefore, there are 300 7-digit positive integers that remain the same after the 180° rotation.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Palindromic Numbers**: Numbers that read the same forward and backward.
2. **Digit Symmetry**: Understanding how digits change under rotation.
3. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of valid combinations of digits.
