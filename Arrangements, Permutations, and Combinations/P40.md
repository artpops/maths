# Problem
Let us take 6 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 10 yellow balls. Balls of the same color are numbered and hence distinguishable. How many ways are there to arrange the balls in a sequence such that any red ball is between a blue and a yellow ball, and no blue ball is adjacent to a yellow ball?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to arrange the balls so that:
        - Any red ball is between a blue and a yellow ball.
        - No blue ball is adjacent to a yellow ball.

2. **Arrange the Blue and Yellow Balls First**:
    - Since no blue ball can be adjacent to a yellow ball, we can start by arranging the blue and yellow balls in an alternating pattern.
    - There are 7 blue balls and 10 yellow balls, so we can have the sequence start and end with a yellow ball.
    - Possible alternating pattern: YBYBYBYBYBYBYBYBYBY

3. **Total Arrangements of Blue and Yellow Balls**:
    - Choose 7 out of 10 positions for the blue balls among the yellow balls.
    - The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{10}{7} = \binom{10}{3} = 120
    $$

4. **Insert the Red Balls**:
    - The red balls must be placed between the blue and yellow balls. In the alternating sequence, each blue and yellow pair (YB, BY) creates a space where a red ball can be placed.
    - There are 7 blue balls, so there are 7 gaps created by these blue-yellow pairs plus additional gaps at the start and end of the sequence, making it 8 gaps in total.
    - We need to place 6 red balls in these 8 gaps.

5. **Choosing Gaps for Red Balls**:
    - The number of ways to choose 6 out of these 8 gaps is given by:
    $$
    \binom{8}{6} = \binom{8}{2} = 28
    $$

6. **Arrange the Red Balls in Chosen Gaps**:
    - Once the gaps are chosen, we can place the 6 red balls in any order within these gaps.
    - The number of ways to arrange 6 red balls is given by:
    $$
    6! = 720
    $$

7. **Total Arrangements**:
    - Combine the arrangements of blue and yellow balls, the choice of gaps, and the arrangement of red balls:
    $$
    120 \times 28 \times 720
    $$

8. **Final Calculation**:
    $$
    120 \times 28 \times 720 = 120 \times 20160 = 2419200
    $$

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the balls in a sequence such that any red ball is between a blue and a yellow ball, and no blue ball is adjacent to a yellow ball, is $2,419,200$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Binomial Coefficient**: Counting the number of ways to choose a subset of positions.
2. **Factorials**: Counting the number of ways to arrange distinguishable objects.
3. **Combinatorial Arrangements**: Arranging objects under specific constraints.
