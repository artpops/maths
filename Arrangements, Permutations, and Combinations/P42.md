# Problem
Given $n$ indistinguishable balls and $m$ boxes numbered $1, 2, \ldots, m$. How many ways can the balls be put into the boxes such that:
(a) every box contains at least one ball?
(b) there are exactly $k$ balls in the first box, and every box contains at least one ball?
(c) there are exactly $k$ balls in the first box?
(d) for any $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$, the $k$-th box contains at least $k$ balls?

## Part (a): Every box contains at least one ball

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to distribute $n$ indistinguishable balls into $m$ boxes such that each box has at least one ball.

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
    - Use the "stars and bars" theorem with the condition that each box contains at least one ball.
    - Let each box initially have 1 ball. This uses up $m$ balls, leaving $n - m$ balls to be distributed freely.

3. **Stars and Bars**:
    - We now need to distribute the remaining $n - m$ balls into $m$ boxes without any restrictions.
    - The number of ways to do this is given by:
    $$
    \binom{(n-m) + (m-1)}{m-1} = \binom{n-1}{m-1}
    $$

## Part (b): Exactly $k$ balls in the first box, and every box contains at least one ball

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - The first box contains exactly $k$ balls, and the remaining $m-1$ boxes each contain at least one ball.

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
    - Place $k$ balls in the first box, leaving $n - k$ balls to be distributed among the remaining $m-1$ boxes with each containing at least one ball.
    - Use the same approach as in part (a) but with $n - k$ balls and $m - 1$ boxes.

3. **Stars and Bars**:
    - The number of ways to distribute the remaining $n - k$ balls into $m - 1$ boxes is given by:
    $$
    \binom{(n-k) - (m-1) + (m-2)}{m-2} = \binom{n-k-1}{m-2}
    $$

## Part (c): Exactly $k$ balls in the first box

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - The first box contains exactly $k$ balls, and the remaining $n - k$ balls can be distributed into the $m$ boxes without any restriction.

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
    - Place $k$ balls in the first box, leaving $n - k$ balls to be distributed among $m$ boxes.

3. **Stars and Bars**:
    - The number of ways to distribute $n - k$ balls into $m$ boxes is given by:
    $$
    \binom{(n-k) + (m-1)}{m-1} = \binom{n-k+m-1}{m-1}
    $$

## Part (d): The $k$-th box contains at least $k$ balls for any $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - The $k$-th box must contain at least $k$ balls.

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
    - Initially place $k$ balls in the $k$-th box for each $k$. This uses up $\sum_{k=1}^{m} k = \frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ balls, leaving $n - \frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ balls to be distributed freely.

3. **Stars and Bars**:
    - The number of ways to distribute the remaining $n - \frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ balls into $m$ boxes is given by:
    $$
    \binom{n - \frac{m(m+1)}{2} + (m-1)}{m-1} = \binom{n - \frac{m(m+1)}{2} + m - 1}{m-1}
    $$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Stars and Bars**: A method for distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins.
2. **Binomial Coefficients**: Used to calculate the number of ways to distribute balls under various constraints.
