# Problem
How many permutations $i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n j_1 j_2 \ldots j_n$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$ are there such that the following inequalities hold:

$i_1 < j_1, \quad i_2 < j_2, \quad \ldots, \quad i_n < j_n,$
$i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_n, \quad j_1 < j_2 < \cdots < j_n$

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to count the permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$ that satisfy the given inequalities.
    - The set is divided into two subsequences: $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n$ and $j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_n$.
    - Each subsequence must be in increasing order.

2. **Choosing the Positions**:
    - We need to choose $n$ positions out of $2n$ for the $i_k$'s.
    - The remaining $n$ positions will automatically be for the $j_k$'s.

3. **Counting the Choices**:
    - The number of ways to choose $n$ positions out of $2n$ is given by the binomial coefficient:
    $\binom{2n}{n}$

4. **Result**:
    - Since each choice of $n$ positions for the $i_k$'s automatically determines the positions for the $j_k$'s, the number of valid permutations is:
    $\binom{2n}{n}$
