# Problem
How many 5-digit positive integers are there that are divisible by 5 and without a repetition of digits?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find 5-digit numbers where all five digits are distinct and the number is divisible by 5.
    - A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.

2. **Case 1: Last Digit is 0**:
    - If the last digit is 0, the remaining four digits must be chosen from 1 to 9 without repetition.
    - Choices for the first digit: 9 choices (1 to 9)
    - Choices for the second digit: 8 remaining choices
    - Choices for the third digit: 7 remaining choices
    - Choices for the fourth digit: 6 remaining choices

    The total number of combinations for this case is:
    $9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 3024$

3. **Case 2: Last Digit is 5**:
    - If the last digit is 5, the remaining four digits must be chosen from 0 to 9 without 5 and without repetition.
    - Choices for the first digit: 8 choices (1 to 9 except 5)
    - Choices for the second digit: 8 remaining choices (0 to 9 except the first digit and 5)
    - Choices for the third digit: 7 remaining choices
    - Choices for the fourth digit: 6 remaining choices

    The total number of combinations for this case is:
    $8 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 2688$

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**:
    - Add the combinations from both cases:
    $3024 + 2688 = 5712$

Therefore, there are 5712 five-digit positive integers that are divisible by 5 and without a repetition of digits.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Divisibility Rules**: Understanding that a number divisible by 5 ends in 0 or 5.
2. **Permutations**: Arranging items (digits) where the order matters.
3. **Counting Principle**: Multiplying the number of choices for each independent event.
4. **Constraints**: Ensuring digits are distinct and considering different cases based on the last digit.
