# Problem
Determine all positive integers with an odd number of divisors.

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the positive integers that have an odd number of divisors.

2. **Analyze the Divisors of a Number**:
    - A divisor $d$ of a number $n$ usually pairs with another divisor $\frac{n}{d}$ such that $d \times \frac{n}{d} = n$.
    - If $n$ has an odd number of divisors, there must be a divisor that pairs with itself, i.e., $d = \frac{n}{d}$, which means $d^2 = n$.

3. **Identify Numbers with Odd Number of Divisors**:
    - The only numbers that have a divisor pairing with itself are perfect squares because only perfect squares have such a divisor.
    - For example, $n = 36$ has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36, and the pair 6 pairs with itself because $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the positive integers with an odd number of divisors are exactly the perfect squares.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Divisor Pairing**: Each divisor pairs with another divisor except in the case of perfect squares.
2. **Perfect Squares**: Numbers that can be expressed as $d^2$ for some integer $d$, which have an odd number of divisors.
