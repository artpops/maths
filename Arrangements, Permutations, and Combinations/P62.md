# Problem
How many permutations $(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ are there such that the sum $|p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \cdots + |p_n - n|$ has the greatest possible value?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to maximize the sum of absolute differences between the positions and the values in a permutation.
    - The goal is to maximize $|p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \cdots + |p_n - n|$.

2. **Observations**:
    - The absolute difference $|p_i - i|$ is maximized when the difference between $p_i$ and $i$ is maximized.
    - To maximize this sum, we should place the smallest number in the largest position and vice versa.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
    - One optimal permutation is to place the smallest number in the largest position, the second smallest in the second largest position, and so on.
    - For example, the permutation that achieves this is $(n, n-1, \ldots, 1)$.

4. **Maximizing the Sum**:
    - In the permutation $(n, n-1, \ldots, 1)$, the sum of the absolute differences is:
    $|n - 1| + |(n-1) - 2| + \cdots + |2 - (n-1)| + |1 - n|$
    - This can be calculated as:
    $(n-1) + (n-3) + \cdots + 3 + 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2i - 1)$
    \
    - This sum is equal to $n(n-1)/2$.

5. **Number of Such Permutations**:
    - Each permutation that mirrors the above pattern will achieve the maximum sum.
    - This includes both $(n, n-1, \ldots, 1)$ and its reverse $(1, 2, \ldots, n)$.
    - There are exactly $2$ such permutations.
