# Problem
How many ways are there to arrange $n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k$ distinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable boxes, such that, for any $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$, the $i$-th box contains exactly $n_i$ balls?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to distribute $n$ distinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable boxes such that the $i$-th box contains exactly $n_i$ balls, where $n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k$.

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
    - The number of ways to distribute $n$ distinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable boxes with the specified counts in each box is equivalent to counting the number of ways to arrange the $n$ balls, taking into account the groupings of $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ balls in the respective boxes.

3. **Using Multinomial Coefficient**:
    - The number of ways to arrange $n$ distinguishable balls into groups of sizes $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ is given by the multinomial coefficient:
    $$
    \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
    $$
    - This formula accounts for the fact that the balls within each group (box) are distinguishable, and each arrangement of balls in boxes respects the specified counts.

4. **Calculation**:
    - Thus, the number of ways to arrange $n$ distinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable boxes such that the $i$-th box contains exactly $n_i$ balls is:
    $$
    \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
    $$

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange $n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k$ distinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable boxes, such that, for any $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$, the $i$-th box contains exactly $n_i$ balls, is:
$$
\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
$$

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Multinomial Coefficient**: Counting the number of ways to arrange distinguishable objects into groups of specified sizes.
2. **Factorials**: Used to calculate the number of permutations of objects in each group.
