# Problem
How many 6-digit positive integers are there such that there are exactly three distinct digits in the decimal representation of each of them, and the digit 0 does not appear?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of 6-digit numbers that use exactly three distinct digits from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ (since 0 is not allowed).

2. **Choose the Digits**:
    - We need to choose 3 distinct digits from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. The number of ways to choose 3 digits out of 9 is given by:
    $$
    \binom{9}{3}
    $$

3. **Arrange the Digits**:
    - Once the digits are chosen, they can appear in any order in the 6-digit number, with repetition allowed.
    - The total number of ways to arrange these 3 chosen digits in 6 positions is given by:
    $$
    \text{multinomial coefficient} = \frac{6!}{n_1! n_2! n_3!}
    $$
    - Where $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$ are the frequencies of the three chosen digits in the 6-digit number.
    
4. **Ensure the Number is 6-Digit**:
    - The first digit cannot be zero, but in this problem, zero is not allowed at all. So, any of the chosen digits can be the first digit.

5. **Count the Valid Combinations**:
    - Let's consider different frequency distributions of the three digits. The possible distributions are:
      - $(4,1,1)$: 1 digit appears 4 times, and each of the other two digits appears 1 time.
      - $(3,2,1)$: 1 digit appears 3 times, another digit appears 2 times, and the third digit appears 1 time.
      - $(2,2,2)$: Each of the three digits appears 2 times.

    - For each distribution, calculate the number of valid combinations and sum them up.

6. **Calculate the Number of Combinations for Each Distribution**:
    - **Distribution $(4,1,1)$**:
      - Number of ways to choose which digit appears 4 times: $\binom{3}{1} = 3$
      - Number of ways to choose positions for this digit: $\binom{6}{4} = 15$
      - Number of ways to arrange the remaining 2 digits in 2 positions: $\binom{2}{1} = 2$
      - Total for $(4,1,1)$: $3 \times 15 \times 2 = 90$

    - **Distribution $(3,2,1)$**:
      - Number of ways to choose which digit appears 3 times: $\binom{3}{1} = 3$
      - Number of ways to choose which digit appears 2 times out of the remaining 2: $\binom{2}{1} = 2$
      - Number of ways to choose positions for the digit appearing 3 times: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$
      - Number of ways to choose positions for the digit appearing 2 times out of the remaining 3: $\binom{3}{2} = 3$
      - Total for $(3,2,1)$: $3 \times 2 \times 20 \times 3 = 360$

    - **Distribution $(2,2,2)$**:
      - Number of ways to choose positions for the first digit: $\binom{6}{2} = 15$
      - Number of ways to choose positions for the second digit out of the remaining 4: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$
      - The third digit automatically takes the remaining 2 positions.
      - Total for $(2,2,2)$: $15 \times 6 = 90$

7. **Sum the Combinations**:
    - The total number of valid 6-digit numbers is:
    $$
    90 + 360 + 90 = 540
    $$

    - Multiply by the number of ways to choose 3 distinct digits from 9:
    $$
    540 \times \binom{9}{3} = 540 \times 84 = 45360
    $$

Therefore, there are 45,360 6-digit positive integers such that there are exactly three distinct digits in the decimal representation of each of them, and the digit 0 does not appear.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose and arrange subsets.
2. **Multinomial Coefficient**: Calculating the number of ways to distribute items into different bins.
3. **Constraints**: Ensuring that the chosen numbers meet the specified requirements (three distinct digits, no zero).
