# Problem
A group consists of six mathematicians. How many ways can they form five committees each consisting of three members, such that no two of these committees consist of the same three mathematicians?

# Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of ways to form five distinct committees from a group of six mathematicians where each committee has three members.

2. **Counting the Committees**:
    - First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 members out of 6. This can be done using the binomial coefficient:
    $$
    \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20
    $$
    - This means there are 20 possible ways to choose a committee of 3 members from 6 mathematicians.

3. **Forming Five Committees**:
    - Since we need to form five committees, we need to ensure that all five committees are distinct.
    - The problem implicitly requires us to find if it's possible to choose 5 out of the 20 possible committees such that they do not overlap.
    - Since 20 is the total number of possible combinations and we only need 5, we simply need to ensure that all chosen committees are distinct.

4. **Selecting the Committees**:
    - The number of ways to choose 5 distinct committees out of 20 is given by:
    $$
    \binom{20}{5} = \frac{20!}{5!(20-5)!} = \frac{20!}{5!15!}
    $$
    - However, this is the selection of 5 committees out of 20 without considering any specific constraints.

Therefore, the number of ways to form five committees each consisting of three members from a group of six mathematicians, such that no two of these committees consist of the same three mathematicians, is $\binom{20}{5}$.

# Important Concepts Used
1. **Combinatorics**: Counting the number of ways to choose subsets from a larger set.
2. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using $\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements.
3. **Combination Constraints**: Ensuring that the chosen committees are distinct.
